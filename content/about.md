title: About Me
---

Hey, I am Kevin, an enthusiast open-source developer, currently working at [Traefik Labs](https://traefik.io/). I am
working on [Traefik Proxy](https://github.com/traefik/traefik#readme)
and [Traefik Mesh](https://github.com/traefik/mesh#readme) and multiple things to make networking boring.

I have been programming for a long time, and I am passionate about everything related to Go, Network, Containers, Cloud,
and Distributed systems.

Last but not least, I am also a space cat lover!
