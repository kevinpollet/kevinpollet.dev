As said in the description, every journey has a beginning and here is a little write-up for the beginning of my blogging
journey. In the past I've created many blogs but nothing was publicly available or updated because I was not satisfied
by the result. As a therapy and to improve my writing skills, I will try to post articles on a regular basis on
things I've learned or hacked during my developer journey, which have started 10 years ago, even if it's not perfect in
my point of view.
